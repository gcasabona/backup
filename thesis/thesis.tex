%%  THE ABSTRACT
%%  ============
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.4 Abstract
%%  --------------
%%  The thesis or dissertation must contain an abstract    a concise summary of
%%  the thesis or dissertation intended to inform a prospective reader about
%%  its content. It usually includes a brief description of the problem
%%  investigated, the procedures or methods used, the findings, and the
%%  conclusions. It may use one or a few paragraphs; however, it is very rare
%%  that an abstract should use more than two pages, and many use just one page. 
%%
\abstract[long]{%
Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are believed to result from the thermonuclear explosions of carbon-oxygen white dwarfs.  While important as standardizable candles, and sources of nuclear enrichment and cosmic rays, the stellar progenitors, as well as the mechanism for detonation of SNe Ia are still unknown. In previous collaborative work, I have shown that a turbulently-driven mechanism can give rise to a detonation in carbon-oxygen electron-degenerate fuel in the distributed burning regime. We have now extended this turbulently-driven detonation mechanism to simulate the detonation of carbon in the presence of helium. Using high-resolution local three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations with the FLASH4 code, I explore a range of parameter space motivated by leading progenitor models of SNe Ia. I show that the helium abundance greatly affects the range of conditions needed to detonate carbon in electron-degenerate matter. These local models can then be used in subgrid models of nuclear burning and detonation initiation in future global simulations of SNe Ia.

%%  THE ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
%%  ====================
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.5 Acknowledgments
%%  ---------------------
%%  Short statements of acknowledgment of indebtedness (e.g., thanks to one  s
%%  thesis or dissertation advisor, to other professors, to people who have
%%  given support) may appear on a separate page right after the abstract. An
%%  acknowledgments section is required if the author has received permission to
%%  use previously copyrighted material or is obliged to acknowledge grant
%%  sources. This section is present in most theses or dissertations and is used
%%  to express a very specific professional or personal indebtedness. For
%%  example, significant instances of collaboration with one or more others in
%%  one  s thesis or dissertation work would probably need acknowledgment in a
%%  Preface (see 5.1.8) or in this Acknowledgments section  for example, research
%%  undertaken together with another student or use of much material from some
%%  other investigator.
%%
%%  The acknowledgements should be written in a professional manner. When
%%  writing the acknowledgments, be sure that your use of   person   is
%%  consistent.  If you begin with references to yourself as   the author,  
%%  continue to use third person throughout. If you begin with first person
%%  (  I,     me,     my  ), use first person consistently.  There are two accepted
%%  spellings of the word   acknowledgments   (the other is   acknowledgements  );
%%  be sure to spell this word consistently.
%%

	This work used the code FLASH 4.0.1, developed by the DOE NNSA-ASC OASCR Flash Center at the University of Chicago. Simulations ran in parallel on the Extreme Science and Engineering Discovery Environment (XSEDE) Stampede2 supercomputer at the University of Texas at Austin's Texas Advanced Computing Center. Plots and analysis of our runs were done with yt. Special thanks to Professor Robert Fisher, for providing the proper guidance in physics and computational techniques to make this work possible and also for providing me with a Research Assistantship. I would also like to thank the Physics department at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth for their continued support as I advance in my academic career, as well as the university as a whole for providing me with exceptional care to all my needs as a student.

%%  THE PREFACE (optional)
%%  ======================
%%
%%  From the UMass Dartmouth Thesis Guide
%%  "Requirements for Theses and Dissertations" (Spring 2015) 
%%  
%%  5.1.8 Preface (optional)
%%  ------------------------
%%  Most theses or dissertations will not have a Preface, which is called for
%%  only for unusual reasons, e.g., when the genesis of the work needs to be
%%  explained or when the author  s contribution to a multiple-authored work must
%%  be noted. If there is a preface, however, it would incorporate any
%%  acknowledgments instead of those appearing as a separate section.
%%  
%%  Preface sections are rarely used.  The first chapter (sometimes called
%%    Introduction  ) in the text section is the appropriate place for
%%  explanations of the context or the motivations that underlie the research,
%%  the research problem, the background of previous scholarship, notable
%%  contributions by other scholars, and so forth. Use a   Preface   section only
%%  for special purposes beyond such purposes as these; examples of such a
%%  special purpose are covered in sections 7.4 and 8.5.
%%  
%%
%%  7.4 Translations by the Author of Material Used
%%  ----------------------------------------------- 
%%  Material that you translate is still the intellectual property of the
%%  author. It must be documented fully (its original-language source cited
%%  properly and included in the bibliography). An appropriate note indicates by
%%  whom it has been translated, by you or someone else. If a thesis or
%%  dissertation will have extensive use of such material, this might be an
%%  occasion for an explanation in a Preface.  Usually, translators of published
%%  works will be indicated in the standard documentation of your notes and/or
%%  bibliography.
%% 
%%  8.5 Collaborative Work That Will Appear in a Thesis or Dissertation
%%  -------------------------------------------------------------------
%%  A thesis or dissertation must represent work done principally if not
%%  entirely by the author. When there are minor instances of research
%%  collaboration, an appropriate citation may be used. If extensive, however,
%%  the committee must approve it in detail and an explanation in a Preface
%%  section is called for (see sections 5.1.8).
%% 
%%  
%%  The preface should be written in a professional manner. When writing the
%%  acknowledgments, be sure that your use of   person   is consistent.  If you
%%  begin with references to yourself as â the author,â  continue to use third
%%  person throughout. If you begin with first person (  I,     me,     my  ), use
%%  first person consistently.

%%
%%  THE EPIGRAPH (optional)
%%  =======================
%%
%%  Some authors include a quotation (epigraph) or illustration (frontispiece)
%%  as the last of their preliminary pages. Neither should be listed in the
%%  table of contents, although a frontispiece may be included in the list of
%%  illustrations. The source of an epigraph is indicated below the quotation
%%  but is not listed in the bibliography or references unless it is also
%%  cited in the text. A page number need not be shown, but the page is
%%  counted in the sequential page numbering.

%%  The default option is a epigraph (text).
%%  The two LaTeX commands below will produce the same output.
%%
%\epigraph{%

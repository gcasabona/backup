In your kernel implementation of tiled matrix multiplication, how many threads can be simultaneously scheduled for execution on	a GeForce GTX-680 GPU?


In our implementation, we are using NxN tiles, with N = 32 threads. Therefore, each block has 1024 elements. The GeForce GTX-680 GPU can simultaneously run 16 blocks or 2048 threads at a time, whichever maxes out first. Since our blocks only have 1024 elements each, we can only run two blocks simultaneously.

When running the command,

nvcc -gencode=arch=compute_30,code=\"sm_30,compute_30\"
--ptxas-options=-v matrixmul_kernel.cu

we get the following result:

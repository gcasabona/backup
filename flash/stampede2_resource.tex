\section{Resources}

With our current helium-detonation project on Stampede2, I have 6 high-resolution 3D simulations that still need to be run and analyzed. Smaller versions of these runs will be conducted, since the analysis of C12 and He4 around the time of detonation is what's needed. Per run, I will use 64 nodes for 6 hours, with a total of 6 total runs. This puts me at 2304 SUs. I'd like round this up to 2500 SUs to account for any smaller bug that may arise, along with the analysis scripts and generating any plots or movies as needed. The analysis scripts take about a minute to run.
